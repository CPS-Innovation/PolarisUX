               <p> I am writing this statement in relation to my partner, Eoin McLove.</p>
<p>I have been in a relationship with Eoin for around 5 years. We married 4 years ago and had one child
together aged 3. At first our relationship was fine but Eoin started to be very aggressive towards me a
year after we met whenever he was drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Eoinâ€™s behaviour towards me escalated when he started checking my phone (<span class="searchFound">07747 555 5555</span>) and asking who I had
been talking with on a daily basis. Eoin seemed to have developed a drinking problem and that was
when things in our relationship got very bad.</p>
<p>When I fell pregnant in 2016 I hoped that Eoin would calm his drinking but unfortunately things got
worse and that is when he first assaulted me. I was three months pregnant when he first hit me giving
me a black eye. I did not report that to the Police at the time. Around a month later he assaulted me
again hitting me to the head and the stomach. I suffered some stomach pains and was taken to hospital
after I called the Police. I refused to provide a statement. Social services became involved as a result
of this. This initially seemed to calm Eoin and things were ok for a while.</p>
