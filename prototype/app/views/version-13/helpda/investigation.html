            <p style="">This is where the Crown Prosecution Service review the evidence and materials submitted by the police to ascertain whether to charge the case. The Prosecuting lawyer looking at the case follows <a href="">guidance </a> set out by the <a href="">Director of Public Prosecutions </a> for England and Wales</p>
            <p>The prosecutor is looking for the case to satisfy two key parts of this guidance known as the <a href="">Full Code Test </a> which are: </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>There is enough probable evidence to secure a conviction if the case went to Court </li>
              <li>Making a charge is in the public interest, for example the offender is likely to reoffend</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Charging the case will mean your case will <a href="">proceed to the next step.</a> You may at this point hear that the case is not proceeding, known as no further action.  </p>
            <p>If either the police or CPS later decide not to proceed or substantially change the charge(s) they have previously discussed with you, you will be told the reasons why within five working days. </p>

                     <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"  style="margin-top:20px; color:white">What signifies this stage?</h2>
            <p style="">When the police submit a case to CPS they disclose all materials pertaining to the case. This means they may have asked you for a lot of details upfront. This can feel intimidating but is crucial in getting the materials to CPS to charge. At this point: </p>
             <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Police have take a <a href="">statement</a> </li>
              <li>You have been asked to provide <a href="">evidence </a> to form a case, including your phone, photos of injuries</li>
              <li>The defendant has had an <a href="">interview with the police </a> </li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may have further requests from the police for more information in this time. This isn’t [because they don’t believe you]. It is likely that the prosecution team at CPS have asked the police to retrieve more information to satisfy the points above. </p>
            </div>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"  style="margin-top:35px">What can you do?</h2>
            <p style="">[This can be a challenging period due to the amount of information you need to provide to the police. It can be a lot without a guarantee of charge, or it may not be clear why the police and prosecution team need the details they do.</p>
            <p>Respond to requests for more information as best as you can. You may also need to supply evidence from media devices such as your phone or your computer. This information is then passed onto the <a href="">CPS </a> to decide if there is enough evidence to charge the abuser with a criminal offense. You have the right to speak to ask the officers involved in the case why that information is required. </p>
            <p>You should discuss with your <a href="">investigating officer </a>anything that you think will help CPS make a decision. You might also consider friends or family who can <a href="">support your testimony </a>by supplying more evidence. </p>
            <div class="govuk-inset-text">
              It might feel like there is a lot of focus on your testimony, but there will be equal focus on the defendant’s, including their previous record.
            </div>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-l"  style="">Further incidents?</h2>
            <p style="">[In many domestic abuse cases it’s normal for the perpetrator to still be in contact with you (in the early stages of the process). This can be standard communication about <a href="">childcare arrangements </a>, but it can also be <a href="">threatening, coercive or controlling behaviour </a>. Threatening behaviour or things that make you unsafe in person or online are not acceptable and should be <a href="">reported </a></p>
            <p>Threatening behaviour could be: </p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
              <li>Turning up at your residence, workplace or education facility</li>
              <li>Frequent calls or messages to yourself or your family</li>
              <li>Any action which causes serious distress and has an adverse effect on your day to day activities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you feel under pressure not to continue your case for any of these reasons please contact your investigating officer. You can ask to be referred to an <a href="">Independent domestic violence advisors (IDVA)’</a>s who can advise you on any situation where you feel at risk. If you are experiencing further incidents which could comprise your participation in your case. Your investigating your case may refer you via a <a href="">Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences (MARAC). </a> </p>

            <p style="">You may have been physically hurt by a person or they may have hurt you using an object</p>
            <p>You may have suffered from a pattern of behaviour or incidents that enable a person to exert power or control over you known as such as isolating you from your friends and family, taking control of your finances or everyday activities like what you wear or who you see, or tracking your movements through the internet or mobile phone use and stopping you from leaving. </p>
            <p> You may have suffered from an act or a pattern of acts of assaults, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten you known as <a href="">coercive behaviour</a></p>
            <p>You may have been <a href="">stalked</a> if you have suffered from a pattern of unwanted, fixated or obsessive behaviour which is intrusive, and causes you fear of violence or serious alarm and distress. For example, you may have been watched or spied on or the abuser may be forcing contact with you through social media. </p>

            <p>Domestic abuse includes physical or sexual abuse, violent or threatening behaviour, controlling or coercive behaviour, economic abuse and psychological, emotional, or other abuse. It can be prosecuted under a range of offences and it does not matter whether the behaviour consists of a single incident or a course of conduct.</p>
