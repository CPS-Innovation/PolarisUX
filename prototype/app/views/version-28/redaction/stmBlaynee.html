                <p>I am a serving Police Officer in Anyshire Police force. On the 1st June I was on duty patrolling the North Marsh area.
                    At approximately 21:35 I received a call via the control room to attend an ongoing incident in the North Marsh area.</p>
                <p>I was informed that a red Nissan motor vehicle had left an address at Accacia Road and that the driver may be drunk.</p>
                <p>I arrived quickly at the scene and at the top of Accacia road I saw a red Nissan car <span class="searchFound">VRM YK12HOO</span> at the junction of Accacia Road and Electric Avenue. I immediately activated my lights and pulled up behind the vehicle.</p>
                <p>Inside the vehicle was one white male who I now know to be EOIN MCLOVE. On speaking to the occupant I formed the opinion that he was drunk. His eyes were glazed and his speech was slurred. He started to become aggressive and abusive towards me when I asked him to step out of the car. EOIN MCLOVE refused to provide a sample of breath for a roadside screening and as such I arrested him on suspicion of driving whilst over the proscribed limit so that an effective sample could be obtained at the Police station.</p>
